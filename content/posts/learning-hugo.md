This month in my Web Development class Deployment of Web Applications I am learning several new things. One of these is Hugo. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) is a framework for building static websites. I have much to learn about it still, but so far it is something I am interested in learning more about. <!--more-->It seems especially good for blog websites, portfolios, documentation and the like- sites that do not require a database. I really like the documentation and instructions for installing and getting a quick website up and running. 

They also have a community collection of pre-made themes to make it even easier for you to create a slick looking website quickly. This enables even those that are not familiar with HTMl and CSS to be able to use this framework. They just need to know basic terminal usage knowledge to install Hugo and they can use a pre-made theme and just use markdown to create their posts. From there they would just need to choose a place to host their website such as GitHub Pages.
