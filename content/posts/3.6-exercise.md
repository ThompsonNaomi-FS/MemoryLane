Going through the React Native demos was a lot of new information. I found it interesting and it looks fun to play around with. The simulator tool where you can see your project on different platforms would be handy for future projects. It is so much easier than adjusting a browser window to see what it might look like on different screen sizes. 
Two features stood out most to me. Navigation from one page to the next was easy to set up. I also like the Platform tool for changing styling for different platforms. 
Learning all this new stuff is interesting but it also gives me anxiety trying to remember all these different things well enough to use them in further classes.
