Last month I was in a class called Programming for Web Applications. This class worked with connecting to a database and learning how to encrypt a password to keep you users information more secure. <!--more-->
We learned how to encrypt with JSON Web Tokens, or JWT. JWT is used for authorization as opposed to authentication. It is authorizing if the client has permission to use the application. The user information is stored in the token itself on the client instead of in the server. This allows you to use the same token across multiple servers that you might be running.
